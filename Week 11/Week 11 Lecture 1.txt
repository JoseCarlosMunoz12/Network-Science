Basics of Game Theory
	Why Games?
		Diffusion, two models of difussion(read lecture)
		Fractional and linear threshold of the model
		Fractional model
			The threshold is a number between 0 and 1
			Initial adopters for each of the node. If the fractional number of node passes the threshold it is pass through
		Linear model
			Each node is an input weight. Natural wieght of node of a to b. Sum of all different weigh
		The main question, how can we determine its threshold?
			A natural approah is based on game theory
		Two mains apsects of networks
			Strucutre of links: who is linked to whome
			Behavior: the otucome for any one node depends (Explicitily or implicitly on the combined behavrio)
		Ex of game
			Diffusion and network trafficing
	Payoff Matrix
		Situation
			you have two large pieces of workd due the enxt day, and exam and a join presentation with partner
			you can eitehr study for the xam or prepare for the presentation, bu not both
			both can't communicatte
			what is your coice to maximize your average grade
			4 distince strategies.
			P and E
				if choose P, then both get 90,90
				if you choose P and they chose E, then
				[90,90 | 86,92]
				[86,92 | 88,88]
		Terminology
			Players: you and your partner
			Strategies: to prepare for the presetntaiton
			Outcome: the combinde choise of strategies
			Payoff: the average grade for a given outcome
			Payoff Matrix: the table for payoffs
		Definition and Notation
			a normal form game <1,2,.., n>
			a set of n players <S_1, S_2, ..., S_n>
			a set of strategies
			a payoff function
			A Max Min / Min Max strategies to optimize once win
		Famous Example is the Prisonerr's Dilemma
			[-4 ,-4 | 0,-10]
			[-10, 0 |-1, -1]
			Read section 3.6
	Dominant Strategies
		The Assumption is that each person cares about them, they are selfish
		Complete Knowledge
			it is assume that each person knows the overall payoffs for each of the players decision
		Rationality
			Each player wants to maximize hi or her own payoff
			Each player chooses an optimal strategy
	Best Response
		the best choice of one player, given a belief about the other player's choice.
		Dominant Strategy is the best response foreach of the coice of the player
	Strict Dominant Strategies
		A strategy S for Player 1 is a strict best response to a strategy T for plaeyer to if P_1(S,T) > P_1(S`, T). S` is any other strategy.
		Following Dominant Strategy is not always give you the best payoff
	Reasoning About Behavior
		Rationality:
			if a player has a strictly dominant strategy, it is rational for him/her to choose that strategy
		Three cases
			When both players have strict dominant, then choose that
			if only has a striclty dominant, then the other person will choose best response
			if neither has striclty dominant strategy, would be har dto determine
Thresholds and Payoffs
	Game for a single edge
		Two nodes connected by an edge
		Strategies: each node has two strategies A and B
		Payoffs
			if choose A, get a payoff of a > 0
			if choose B, get b payoff of b > 0
			if they choose oppisite, then the payoff is 0
			[a,a | 0,0]
			[0,0 | b,b]
	More than one neighbor
		if v choses a, then (pda
		if choose b, then its (1-p)db
		p is the fraction of the nieghbors of b that have behavior A. d is the number of nieghbors of b
	Threshold rule
		if pda > (1-p)db, then the choice of A is better other wise, choose B
		so if p > \frac{b}{a + b}
	The threshold q = \frac{b}{a + b}
		if a fraction of your nieghbors that uses behavior A is at least q, the you will switch to A
		\frac{2}{3 + 2} = 2/5
		A is 3/7, since 3/7 is larger than q, then we go to A
	Example
		a = 3, b = 2; q = 2/5
		Read more about the Cascade Stops and Complete Cascade
		
		how to decrease threshold, need to increase th payoff A, to decrease the threshold
		Can try to decrease B, but that is harder to do
		Changing a set of initial adapters can help with the cascade
	Cascades and Clusters
		Density
			If you belong ot a groupd, many of your friends also tend to belong to this group
			let c be a set of nodes in a graph
			the density of C is defnied as the min{ the fraction of neighbors belonging to c}
			for each contain into C
			the fraction of neighbors belongin ot the cluter to C. cheack all v in C and see which one has the loweset fraction.
			density of cluster, is the fraction threshold to pass to enter the cluster
	Cascades and Density of Groups
		 A set of V_0 initial adaptors will not a cause a complete cascade if and only if the set of v - v0 containa blocker cluster: a group of density greater thatn 1 - q
