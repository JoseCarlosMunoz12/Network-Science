Basics of Game Theory
	Why Games?
		Diffusion, two models of difussion(read lecture)
		Fractional and linear threshold of the model
		Fractional model
			The threshold is a number between 0 and 1
			Initial adopters for each of the node. If the fractional number of node passes the threshold it is pass through
		Linear model
			Each node is an input weight. Natural wieght of node of a to b. Sum of all different weigh
		The main question, how can we determine its threshold?
			A natural approah is based on game theory
		Two mains apsects of networks
			Strucutre of links: who is linked to whome
			Behavior: the otucome for any one node depends (Explicitily or implicitly on the combined behavrio)
		Ex of game
			Diffusion and network trafficing
	Payoff Matrix
		Situation
			you have two large pieces of workd due the enxt day, and exam and a join presentation with partner
			you can eitehr study for the xam or prepare for the presentation, bu not both
			both can't communicatte
			what is your coice to maximize your average grade
			4 distince strategies.
			P and E
				if choose P, then both get 90,90
				if you choose P and they chose E, then
				[90,90 | 86,92]
				[86,92 | 88,88]
		Terminology
			Players: you and your partner
			Strategies: to prepare for the presetntaiton
			Outcome: the combinde choise of strategies
			Payoff: the average grade for a given outcome
			Payoff Matrix: the table for payoffs
		Definition and Notation
			a normal form game <1,2,.., n>
			a set of n players <S_1, S_2, ..., S_n>
			a set of strategies
			a payoff function
			A Max Min / Min Max strategies to optimize once win
		Famous Example is the Prisonerr's Dilemma
			[-4 ,-4 | 0,-10]
			[-10, 0 |-1, -1]
			Read section 3.6
	Dominant Strategies
		The Assumption is that each person cares about them, they are selfish
		Complete Knowledge
			it is assume that each person knows the overall payoffs for each of the players decision
		Rationality
			Each player wants to maximize hi or her own payoff
			Each player chooses an optimal strategy
	Best Response
		the best choice of one player, given a belief about the other player's choice.
		Dominant Strategy is the best response foreach of the coice of the player
