Recap of Last week
	How to Find similarity in a recommender network
	In a recommender network a user has a vector of items. Each item is ranked for each user
	A collaborative filtering = compare user to each user and see which has the most similar vector. Assumption is that the likes and dislikes are constant so each similar user will want or get the same item.
	Two forms of collaborative filtering:
		user to user form
		item to item form
	Presentations to do, yay
	Modularity Networks
Recommender Networks (cont.)
	a vector in this is a row vector. Each user gives a ranking to each item (no ranking if there is none)
	Normalized ratings, an empty ranking is 0.
	to predict what user will prefer, find similarity of each user to them.
	
	Step 1
		Find a user V whose prfile is similar to profile of U
	Step 2
		Fint and item that is a high rating given by V but not yet chosen by U (an empty / 0 weight)
	sim(U,V) = \frac{U * V}{||U|| * ||V||}
	Cosine similarity is the main method used to measure similarity
	ex
		sim(u1,u3) = -0.16 sim(u1,u4) =  0.66
		sim(u1,u5) =  0.17 sim(u1,u2) =  0.27
		user 4 is most similar to user 1
	find item with highest item. If the user already ranked it, don't recommend it.
Item to Item Collaboratie Filtering
	Applied to columns not row
	Find an item that is highly rated by U
	find an item J that is similar to I and not yet being ratd by U
	ex1
		u1 higest rating is I6 (get its column vector)
		find item that is most similar to I6
		cosine simularity.
	ex2
		Find and item I such that
		Ther is no edge between U and I
		the item has the maximum number of 3 step chains to U
		Recommend I to U
		read about the chain method for recommending system
Presentations For Grad Students:
	learn some advance topics of network science
	group of 2 students
	Topics examples to do:
		Networks of Game of Thrones
		Final Fantasy XIV networks of characters
		marvels netowkrs
	Plan, me being predictable
		Network of dinosauria/Pterosaurs
		Diveristy of Traissic to sudden death to show survivability
		Survivabililty of Mass Extinction
Modularity in NetworksI(Homophiliy and Modularity)
	Homophiliy-
		is the principle that individuals tend to associate and bond with similar otherrs.
		assortative mixing- also for homophily
		like people attract like interest
	Rarely people form nodes wth dissamilir nodes
	these networks are called dissarortative mixing
	Colored Graphs
		each node has its own color and represent 
	Modularity is wha we deinfe as the measure of of hte level of homophily
	0 is no homophily, positive means its a assortative mixing, negative is disassortative mixing
	Def
		Need to define modularity for each community
	Q_i is define as
		the actual fration of edges that have both endpoins colored with i
		expected fraction of edges that have both endpoints colored with i if the vertices were colored randomly
	we will define Q_i as the difference betwen thes fractions
	ex
		Actual Fraction
			e_b = 3/12, e_g = 3/12, e_r = 4/12
			there is 12 eges in graph and each group has some number of edges connected
		Expected Fraction
			a_i = k_i/2m
			k_i sum of degrees of all vertice colored with color i
			a_i^2 considered fraction between community. probability that a random edge is inside community i
			Q_i = e_i - a^2_i = e_i - \frac{k_i}{2m}^2
			m is the total number of edges in the color graph
			k is he sum of he degrees of all vertices colored with color i
			e_i is he fractin of edges having both endpoints colored with color i
		Q_b = \frac{3}{12} - \frac{7}{2*12}^2
		Q_g = \frac{3}{12} - \frac{7}{2*12}^2
		Q_r = \frac{4}{12} - \frac{10}{2*12}^2
		Q = 0.49 \SUM{q_i}{i\contain colors}
		
	ex
		e_r =\frac{3}{7}
		e_b =\frac{3}{7}
		k_r = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7
		q_r = \frac{3}{7} - \frac{7 }{2 * 7}^2
		q_r = \frac{3}{7} - \frac{1}{2}^2
