Recap of Last week
	How to Find similarity in a recommender network
	In a recommender network a user has a vector of items. Each item is ranked for each user
	A collaborative filtering = compare user to each user and see which has the most similar vector. Assumption is that the likes and dislikes are constant so each similar user will want or get the same item.
	Two forms of collaborative filtering:
		user to user form
		item to item form
	Presentations to do, yay
	Modularity Networks
Recommender Networks (cont.)
	a vector in this is a row vector. Each user gives a ranking to each item (no ranking if there is none)
	Normalized ratings, an empty ranking is 0.
	to predict what user will prefer, find similarity of each user to them.
	
	Step 1
		Find a user V whose prfile is similar to profile of U
	Step 2
		Fint and item that is a high rating given by V but not yet chosen by U (an empty / 0 weight)
	sim(U,V) = \frac{U * V}{||U|| * ||V||}
	Cosine similarity is the main method used to measure similarity
	ex
		sim(u1,u3) = -0.16 sim(u1,u4) =  0.66
		sim(u1,u5) =  0.17 sim(u1,u2) =  0.27
		user 4 is most similar to user 1
	find item with highest item. If the user already ranked it, don't recommend it.
Item to Item Collaboratie Filtering
	Applied to columns not row
	Find an item that is highly rated by U
	find an item J that is similar to I and not yet being ratd by U
	ex1
		u1 higest rating is I6 (get its column vector)
		find item that is most similar to I6
		cosine simularity.
	ex2
		Find and item I such that
		Ther is no edge between U and I
		the item has the maximum number of 3 step chains to U
		Recommend I to U
		read about the chain method for recommending system
