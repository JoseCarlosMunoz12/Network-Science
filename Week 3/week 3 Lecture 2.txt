Week 3 Lecture 2
Centrality In Networks
	Centrality in Networks 3 way
		Based on importance around their neighbors
		The moer neighbors one node has, the more imprtant they are
	Hub- a node with high degree
	Degree Centrality
	Another example, Social Friends
		more friends, could be more imporant
		problem, fake friends. Not all neighbors are equivalent.
		Might have few degrees, but the nodes are of high imprtance
	given a directed graph, the in-degree centrlaity of a vertex is ht in degree of V
		ex. number of ref. to an article
		draw back, several citation recived from higly cited article may be moreiportant than many citations from low cited articles.
	Need to take into account of Node importance. still
	overcoming the draw back, Eigenvector Centrality, Google's PageRank,  and HITS Ranking
