Recap From Last weeks last excersize
	There is 34 simple graphs with 5 vertices, for last weeks excersize. But how was this calculated?
	Not 34, much bigger. How big? 1024
	k_5 has a total of 10 = ( 5 * 4)/2;
	now any graph is a subgraph of each edges
	how many subset of 10 are there,
	2^10 number of subset of edges. Number of subset of 10 is 2^10.
Centrality in Networks
	study how to measure properties of networks
	Central nodes
		A typicla questi is "Which are the most imprtant or central nodes in a network?"
		have a good position, is important.
		in Image Jill is more important.
		in some measure Jill is not the most important in centrality measure.
	Three Major Aproches to measure Centrality
		1) Closeness centrality:
			Measure importance based on distance to each other node
			as in who has the most neighbors.
		2)Betweenness Centrality:
			determains over who has control over path in the networks. As in who lets what info to pass along the nodes.
		3)Degree Centraility:
			importance of a node is determined by how many neighbots it has and how iportant the neighbors are.
			Google search, eigenvector, degree, HITS Rnaking
