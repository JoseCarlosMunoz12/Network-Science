Recap From Last weeks last excersize
	There is 34 simple graphs with 5 vertices, for last weeks excersize. But how was this calculated?
	Not 34, much bigger. How big? 1024
	k_5 has a total of 10 = ( 5 * 4)/2;
	now any graph is a subgraph of each edges
	how many subset of 10 are there,
	2^10 number of subset of edges. Number of subset of 10 is 2^10.
Centrality in Networks
	study how to measure properties of networks
	Central nodes
		A typicla questi is "Which are the most imprtant or central nodes in a network?"
		have a good position, is important.
		in Image Jill is more important.
		in some measure Jill is not the most important in centrality measure.
	Three Major Aproches to measure Centrality
		1) Closeness centrality:
			Measure importance based on distance to each other node
			as in who has the most neighbors.
		2)Betweenness Centrality:
			determains over who has control over path in the networks. As in who lets what info to pass along the nodes.
		3)Degree Centraility:
			importance of a node is determined by how many neighbots it has and how iportant the neighbors are.
			Google search, eigenvector, degree, HITS Rnaking
	Example of Centrality:
		Medici Family was not the richest family. Rose power because they gain tool by controlling central positions in the netwrok of family inter-marriages. These marriages were keys to communicating inf, making deal and reaching political decisions
	Closeness Centrality:
		Measure centrality based on closness.
		l_i = 1/n\sum^{dij}^{n}_{j=1}
		distance is the length of the closest past from node i to node j
		l_i is the average distance from node i to toher nodes
		the centrality is 1/l_i = n /\sum{d_ij}
		ex
			5/(0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3) = 5 / 8
			5/(1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2) = 5 / 5
			5/(2 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1) = 5 / 6
			5/(3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0) = 5 / 7
		Closeness can be used in some application. it is a good measure of centrality
		Make sense only for connected class. infinite distance in a disconnected graph
		Closness values are well sepearted. This reason is more serious. real world network have close centrality.
		Small world phenomenon occurs in close network.
	Betweenness Centraility:
		Measure centrality based on the control of the shortest path of the graph. The control of flow. 
		Flow vertices are connected by paths along wich something flows. A typical exmaple of flow is inf.
		Shortest path.:
			standard assumption and based on physics, choose shortest path between nodes.
		Control over shortest paths
		number of shortest path between s and t that pass through vertex 2/total number of shortest paths between s and t.
		( numbers of path that passes node i)/# all shortest paths
		pair(s,t), P_i(s,t) number of passes through i from path s to i(shortest)
		P(s,t) total number of shortest path between s and t.
		when calculatin centrality, measure without the node we are intersted. So node pair that dont' include node i
		betweness of vertex 2:
		1/(n-1 2) \sum{\frac{P_i(s,t)}{P(s,t)}}_{s,t}
		make sure that s != i and t != i and s != t
		(1/6)(0) = 0
		(1/6)(1/2 + 1/2 + 0/1 + 0/1 +0 /1 + 0/1)
		(1/6)(1/2 + 1/2 + 0 /1 + 0/1 + 0/1 + 0/1)
		(1/6)(0) = (0 + 1/2)
		Betweenness is really useful for real world networks
		why Betweenness?
			Closness centrality how much a node is connected with other. Betweenness centraily how much a node falls between others. A nodes can be a long way from otehr on average still have high betweness. These nodes allows bridges to be connected with different communities. also called as brokers in sociology
		7.1.6 to 1.17
Excersizes
	1)Betweenness over graph.
		nPr(9 2) = 36 options
		1 betweenness is 0
		2 betweeness is 0 as well
		4 is also 0
	 	3 (20/36) =0.56
		n(n-1)/2
	2) High degree but not the largest closesness
		0-0-0-0-0-0
				-0
		line but last one has 2 degree.Not nececessary the one witht he highest degree
	3) vertex with the largre betweens in no the largest flow.
