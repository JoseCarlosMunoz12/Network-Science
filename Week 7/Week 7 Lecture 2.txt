Random Graphs Recap
	To model a network, what type of graphs can be used?
	A random graph can be an option.
	Random graph G(n,P), G(n,m)
	g(n,p) n for number of nodes, and p is the probability of an edge occuring.
		the expected amount of edges are p*n(n-1)/2
		the expected amount of degree for each node is p(n-1)
		the expected diamter is ln n ln(expected degree)
		the diameter of a giving graph is the maximum distance of a nodes in the graph
	g(n,m) n is number of nodes and m is the number of edges it could have
		Assume all possible graphs with n vertices and m edges. Choose any one of those at random
	for the first Graph, there is a unkown amount of edges in the graph, the second one is that we know the amount of edges
	Random Graphs are not a good model for real world networks
	Transitivity and clustering Coefficients
		Measure of closeness, betweeness and eigenvector coefficitnes
		like how modularity is used for homophily
		Idea:
			the idea of transitivity in networks can be informally expressed as "the friend of my friend is likely my friend too"
		We will define clustering coefficients that measure the level of transitivity
	Clustering Coefficients
		C = number of closed paths of length two/ number of paths of length two
		Clusetering coeffictions of a graph is the fraction of paths of length two that are closed
		the clustering coefficient can be thought of as probability that two people with a common friend are themselves friends.
		what are the odds nodes of w (who is connected with v and v is connected to u) also is conndcted with u
		Clustering coefficient of random 
			coefficient of a random graph (G(n,p)) is just p
		p = 2<m>/ n (n-1) where m is the number of expected edges
		if we apply this to a co-stardom network since we know both m and n, p becomes 0.0003
		So a random graph model is not a right model for real-world networks
		in real world networks, the level of transitivity is pretty high, compare to random graph. Proof that random graphs are not an adequate graph for representing the real world
	Local Clusetering Coefficients
		in local clustering is a measure of each node the level of transitivity based on its neighbors
		for every node i, we dfine a local clustering coefficient C_i as
			if i has at most one nieghbor, then C_i = 0
			else
				C_i = number of pairs of nieghbors of i that are connected/ number of pairs of neighbors of i
		if we have 4 nieghbors, we have 4 choose 2 pairs
		C_i = \frac{# of actual pairs of nieghbor}{ n Choose 2}
		n Choose p = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
		
		An equivalent definition is 
		C=  { 0 if d <= 1
			{\frac{m_i}{d_i(d_i-1)}
			m_i is the number of edge between the nieghbors of i. D is the degree of I
			C_1 = \frac{2 * 3}{ 4 ( 4-1)}
			=\frac{2 * 3}{4 * 3} = \frac{1}{2}
			C_2 = \frac{2 *2}{3(3-1)}
			C_3 = \frac{2 *2}{3(3-1)}=\frac{2}{3}
			C_4 = \frac{2 *1}{2(2-1)}=\frac{1}{1}
			C_5 = 0
			C_6 = \frac{2 *1}{2(2-1)}=\frac{1}{1}
	Questions
		there seems to be some correleation of betweeness and clustering there is a high correlation of betweenness and local clustering
		which holds?
			for node i, the higher the clustering coefficient of i is, the higher the betweeness of i is
			for a node i, the lower the clustering coefficient of i is, the higher the betweenness of i
		The second might makes more sense? ignoring the no edges, information must pass through node I to get to the other nodes. If the transitivity was high, then the information can skip node i to pass informatin.
