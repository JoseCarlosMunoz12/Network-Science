Community Detection
	We have only graph, will want to know which of these nodes are groups.
	each group has many edge within its members, each group has very few edges betweens other groups
	How to define many and few?
	there are some approaches to find these clusters.
	what are the approaches of these
		In Terms of modularity
			Modularity is the measurement for Homophily
			range between -1 and 1
			0 means that there is no Modularity and the class is not dependent
			Is good, but it is an NP problem.
			Doesn't give the best method, but it gives the locally best result
		In Terms of betweenness
			Find the Edge that has Highest betweenness, cull it and then continue.????
			Higher betweenness, its a bridge to another group. Cull it and continue with algorith for some amount of iteration
		In Terms of Hierarchical Clustering
			Also as finding the similarity of each group.
Hierarchical Clustering
	Idea
		Graphs start with single node group, if some of these groups are similar, we merge them. Then we continue the process
	How does on define similarity?
		Shortest path distance
		Similarity for nodes repressented by rows of the adjacency matrix
		Similarity for nodes repressented by thier neighborhood subgraphs
	Now need to decide measure similarity of each of these groups
		Define by best similarity of each group
		Complete linkage similarity
			the similarity is defined by the least similar pair of nodes
		Average-linkage similarity the similarity is defined by the mean similarity among all nodes
	Read about hierarchical clustering method in Section 14.5.2.
