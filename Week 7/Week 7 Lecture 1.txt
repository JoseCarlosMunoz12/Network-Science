Community Detection
	We have only graph, will want to know which of these nodes are groups.
	each group has many edge within its members, each group has very few edges betweens other groups
	How to define many and few?
	there are some approaches to find these clusters.
	what are the approaches of these
		In Terms of modularity
		In Terms of betweenness
			Find the Edge that has Highest betweenness, cull it and then continue.????
			Higher betweenness, its a bridge to another group. Cull it and continue with algorith for some amount of iteration
		In Terms of Hierarchical Clustering
