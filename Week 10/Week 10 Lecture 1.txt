Week 10 Lecture 1
Signed Edges and Balanced Edges
	Signed Graph
		A networkd each edge is lableld with one of the two signes, + or -
		Also as frienship enemies
	Four types of trianles
		in a signd graph, ther are four possible variants of triangles
		Triangles with 3 plus, its a stable
		trianles with 2 enemies and 1 friend, its considered stable
		triangles with two friends and one enemy is a stress and tension
		Triangles with 3 enemies, also unstable. two of them are motivated to team up against the third
	Balanced and unbalanced
		The first two triangles are balanced, the other two are unbalanced
		Since unbalanced triangles are sources of stress and tesnion, people strive to minimize that
	Structural Balance Property
		if G is a signed graph, where each triangle is balance, we say that it is balanced graph. we also say that g has the structural balance property
	Balance Therorem
		if a singed complete graph is balanced, thn there are only two option
			1) all edges are positive
			2) the vertices are partitioned into two groups such that for every edge (u,v), the following Holds
				if u and v are in the same group, (u,v) is +
				if u and v are in different gorus (u,v) is -
		Any complete balance graph can be represented as the above options
	Extension to the model
		its usually not as simple as two groups
		Some extension to thee model
	Only one Unbalanced Triangle
			assume that 1 neg and 2 + as a balance
			
	Weakly balance Graphs
		def A signed graph is weakly balance if it has no trianles with two plus and on minus
		So have several group of mutual friends
	Balance for arbitrary graphs
		we have to define what a balance is for arbitrary signed graphs
	Two Equivalent def
		def 1_ a signed graph is balance if it can be completed by adding labeled edges to form a signed complete graph taht is balanced
		def 2) if it is possible to partitino its vertices into two group that for every edge (u,v) , the following holds
			u and v are in the same group, then its +
			u anv v are in different group, then its -
	How to check to see if the graph can be completed.
		The harary Theorem. a signed graph is balanced if an donly if it contains no cycle with an odd number of negative edges
	Testing for Balance
		to determine if a signed graph is balanced, the first step is to considered th only positive edges to find the connected componenet
	Approximate balance
		Setting for Balance Theorem
		The signed graph is complete
		all triangles are balance
		can we weaken the second requirement? such that only 99% of all triangles are balance?
		Read the theorem from the book
		Section 7.5
Strength of Ties
	Considred networks that each edge is label with a number that show the relationship between them
	Close Friends and Distance Aquiantences
		Some edges in social networkds are strubger than others.
	Bridge like links
		we considered networks in which can be classifiged as storn or weak., in suck networks, bridge like links must be weak
		How does one measure the value of a bridgeness?
			Important information came from distance relationship than from friends
	How to measue strength of ties
		ties between close friends are viewd as strong
		ties between distant acquaintances are viewd as weak
		We measure strength based on communication
		A simplified model is that a tie is either s or w
		Bridge like links are typically wek ties, nost strong ones.
			section 3.4 explains the verification of the experiment
		weak ties are importatn for spreading information across communities
		local brides is an edge if it spant at lest 4
		a span if (u,v) is the distance from u and v if we remove the edge of (u,v)
		Local bridge if its span is at least 3
	Triadic Closure Principle
		Let A be a not ind a netowrk. we say that A satisfies the Triadic Closure Principle if for any two nodes B and C
		edge AB and AC are strong then the must be an edge BC (labeld as strong ork weak)
		if A satisfies the triadic closure principle, any local bridge from A must be a weak tie
	Other Measures of Bridgeness
		\frac{num ofnodes that ar neighbors of u andv}
		{number of ndoes that are neighbosr of least one of u and v}
