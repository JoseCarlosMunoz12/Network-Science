Week 10 Lecture 1
Signed Edges and Balanced Edges
	Signed Graph
		A networkd each edge is lableld with one of the two signes, + or -
		Also as frienship enemies
	Four types of trianles
		in a signd graph, ther are four possible variants of triangles
		Triangles with 3 plus, its a stable
		trianles with 2 enemies and 1 friend, its considered stable
		triangles with two friends and one enemy is a stress and tension
		Triangles with 3 enemies, also unstable. two of them are motivated to team up against the third
	Balanced and unbalanced
		The first two triangles are balanced, the other two are unbalanced
		Since unbalanced triangles are sources of stress and tesnion, people strive to minimize that
	Structural Balance Property
		if G is a signed graph, where each triangle is balance, we say that it is balanced graph. we also say that g has the structural balance property
	Balance Therorem
		if a singed complete graph is balanced, thn there are only two option
			1) all edges are positive
			2) the vertices are partitioned into two groups such that for every edge (u,v), the following Holds
				if u and v are in the same group, (u,v) is +
				if u and v are in different gorus (u,v) is -
		Any complete balance graph can be represented as the above options
