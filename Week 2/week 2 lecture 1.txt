Connectivity in Directed Graphs
	A Connect graph is there is a path between any two nodes in a graph
	Directed Graphs doesn't always let a path of two nodes to travel between each other
	a directed graph G is stronlgy connected if for each vertices u and v
	there is path from u to v and there is a path from v to u
	A Strongly connected Component	
		Each Sub graph of the Graph, has a strongly connected graph. The over graph doesn't necessary needs to all have a path, but each subgraph can
	DFS and BFS can find stronly connected compenent of a graph
	Read sections 6.11-6.12
	hw, 3 about graph, 3 are about next topic
Ex for Graphs
	if G has 100 V and 200 E, then aveage distance is 2 * 200 =? 400 so just 4?
		ans: 4
	Draw graph of 4 vertices
		[[0 1 0 0][0 1 1 0][0 1 1 2][0 0 2 1]]
	draw graph of 1 2,3,3
		ans:not possible because total graph is odd, not even
	A simple graph(doesn't have loops, including parallel loop)
		ans: it is not possible with this
		if simple graph, max adjacent degree is n -1 vertices so since one edge is 4, not possible
	five vertices of 1,2,3,4,5
	is even total so it is possible
	K_n is a complete graph
	each edge of the node contain  n -1
		ans: (n 2) => n choose two
			from n, choose 2
			or (n k) => from n choose k
			its also as n(n-1) /2
		(n k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!)
	can also apply handshake Theorem
		2 * M = n(n-1) each node has n-1 degree
	which set of thse graph are sub graph of G
	W,U,P,R,S
	K_nn is a complete bipartate graph of m and n vertices
	so all edges from m to n
	Complement of the graph is the same vertices but flip from edge to no edge and visa versa
		so, *---*  * => *   *---*
	Is it true that every simple graph has at least two vertices of the same, prove it
		This is true, use the handshake theorem. total edges is 2 * m, m is number of degrees
