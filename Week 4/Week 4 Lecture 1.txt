Efficient Implementation Of PageRank
	Idea of Eigen Vector
		Degree Centrality based on the highest Eigen Value of the of the Adjacency Matrix
		The Eigenvector centralitiy is  the score ofa node is proportional to the sum of the scores of its neighbors.
	Best Eigenvector to choose is the one with the highest and that vector will have the best values and all items are non zero
	Works well with undirected graph, will need to modify it for directed graph
	main problem, in web, some nodes have outgoing but no ingoing edges
PageRank
	Page Ranek is a modification to handle directed graphs
	Random walks on the web
		standard term in graph theorem
	Idea of Page Rank
		why rank, will need to measure node centralitiy of a node in the web.
		a random walker start some arbitray page, of the x number of hyperlinks, we choose one in random. continue this with the next page until desired iterations
		Using this  we can have a higher probabilites of visiting a page if used more.
		if page p is cisited more often than page q, then p is more important than q.
		The rank of page p is the probability of visiting p.
		how do we compute this? It is suprisingly simple
