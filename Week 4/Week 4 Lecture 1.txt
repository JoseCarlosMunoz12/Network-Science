Efficient Implementation Of PageRank
	Idea of Eigen Vector
		Degree Centrality based on the highest Eigen Value of the of the Adjacency Matrix
		The Eigenvector centralitiy is  the score ofa node is proportional to the sum of the scores of its neighbors.
	Best Eigenvector to choose is the one with the highest and that vector will have the best values and all items are non zero
	Works well with undirected graph, will need to modify it for directed graph
	main problem, in web, some nodes have outgoing but no ingoing edges
PageRank
	Page Ranek is a modification to handle directed graphs
	Random walks on the web
		standard term in graph theorem
	Idea of Page Rank
		why rank, will need to measure node centralitiy of a node in the web.
		a random walker start some arbitray page, of the x number of hyperlinks, we choose one in random. continue this with the next page until desired iterations
		Using this  we can have a higher probabilites of visiting a page if used more.
		if page p is cisited more often than page q, then p is more important than q.
		The rank of page p is the probability of visiting p.
		how do we compute this? It is suprisingly simple
	Notation used to describe the model
		N is number of webpags
		Steps, step in the random walk
		Probability if visiting x_i^t is probability of being at i at step t
		Out-Degrees out(i) is the out-degree of page i(number of out going links to pages)
		In Neighbors IN(i) is the set of all pages point to page i
	Ex
		x_1(t) = 0.5
		x_3(t+1) = ?
		there is a total of 5 outgoing degrees
		only 2 outgoing to x_3^{t+1}
		so 2/5(no, need to take into account previous possible nodes chances as well)
		0.5*0.5 + 0.3 * 1/3=
		0.25 + 0.1 = 0.35
	General
		x_k^{t+1} = \sum_{i \contain IN(k)} \frac{x_i^t+1}{out(i)}
		Similar recurrences occur in Markov chains
	Markov chain
		A Directed graph. In whic the state are the nodes and the transitions are the edges. Each edges have a probabilites of being selected
		Transitions Matrices for Markov Chains
		[P] is the probabilty of each transtion
		the summation of each row is 1.(must be 1 for probabilites to make sense)
		The future behavior of Markov chain depends only on its current state, now on how it arrived at the present state
		(not true for all areas but it is useful, also refered as memoryless)
		memoryless - probabilites of next state depends only current state
	Excersizew
		P =
		[
			[0.0 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0]
			[0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0]
			[1/3 1/3 0.0 0.0 1/3 0.0]
			[0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.5]
			[0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.5]
			[0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0]
		]
		it is not a markov chain because row 2 is not 1. an Markov Chain is that it is infinite. The random walk will go on forever
		The web can have nodes that are dead ends, so it is possible to use Markov chain, but will need to modify it
	Stationary Distribution
		How to adjust random walk, to make into a Markov Chain random walk?
