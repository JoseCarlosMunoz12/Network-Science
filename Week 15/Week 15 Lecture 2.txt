Final Exam checking
	Measure Graph and calculating
		calculate betweenesss
			measurement of how many go through them when traveling.
		Calculate the centrality
			the sublte detail of centrality
				C_i = n / \sum{d_ij}
				centrality must be less than or equal to 1
				the smaller the average distance l, the more central the node i is
	Page Rank
		its the measurement of importance of each node in the network
		[] \alpha + (1-\alpha)[]
		Calculate page rank by making sure that each row =1 ( just states chance it will jump to that node)
		\alpha = 1 - \beta
		      [1/3 1/3 1/3 ] +       [0.0 0.0 1.0]
		\alpha[1/3 1/3 1/3 ] + \beta [0.0 0.0 1.0]
		      [1/3 1/3 1/3 ] +       [0.5 0.5 0.0]
		page rank can't be done with directed graph. complication with it.
		directed graph modification allow it be solvable. The stationary distribiution vector is a vector that when multipliied it will  itself. and the total summation of the value of the vector is 1
		Vector can be find if we can see that the distribiution vector follow the pattern in the graph. ie, if the nodes are symmetric, then its value in the distribiution vector should represent this symmetry
		what should be \alpha? smaller on should be the better and display the better it will. but it will worse for conversion, it would more inefficient. a trade off for efficiency and accuracy
	Modularity
		will need to use this for the networkkx data format
		What is modularity - Measurement of homophily. 
		what is homophily
			in a network we have communities(clusters).
			in homophily, nodes of same communities are connected to each other compare to other
			so more edges that go to like clusters than different clusters
		Modularity is the measurement of the level of homophily of the graph
	Decentralized serach with the mypic search algorithm
	
	Random Netowrks scale free
		random network is evenly distributed degree
			have some n amount of nodes with a chance
			G(n,p)
				of connecting with each pair of nods with a chance of p
				expected number edges is
				total pair * pair
				nC2 -> total number of pairs -> \fac{n * n-1}{2}
				\frac{n * (n-1)}{2} p
				all nodes have the same expected degree
				(n-1)p
			G(n,d)
		scale free the degree distribution is logorithmic distributed
			follows the power law
				the degree distribiution is a lopsides graph
				p_k fraction of nodes of degree k
				proportional to k&-\alpha
				all real world networks are scale free distribiution
	Signed Networks
