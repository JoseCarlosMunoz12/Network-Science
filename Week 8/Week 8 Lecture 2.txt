This week will need to get basic properties of the Different Linux distros and have a determine what variables are important

Klienberg's Model for having a Myopic Search.
	Myopic Search is efficient enough, looks at local neighbors and determins which one is closest to the target (ignore thier path and shortcuts, since we don't know those). Keep going until we reach our destination
	A good graph to represent a real world graph would require it to be
		1) Sparse have a small number of edges. num of edges ar proportional to  number of nodes
		2) High Transititvity - neighbors nodes are also are niehgbors to each other
		3) show small world properties
	A fourth properties is Degree Distributions
		This property usually have some commercial application
		Long tail, fat tail

		80-20 rule- 80% of the work is done from 20% people
Degree Distributions
	What is a degree Distribution
		let graph G and m be the maximum degree in G
		for each l, p_k be the fraction of vertices in G that have degree k
		the degree distribution is a sequence p_0, ... p_m
		p_k is the probability that a random vertex in G has degree k
		ex1
			in a graph p_0 = 0.1 means that there is a 10% chance that a vertex has a degree of 0
			p_1 = 0.2. means that there is a 20% chance that a vertex has a degree of 1
			p_0,_1,2,3
		ex2
			there is 4 edges
			p_0 = 0/4=0.00
			p_1 = 1/4=0.25
			p_2 = 2/4=0.50
			p_3 = 1/4=0.25
			
		represent the distribution in a histogram
	Directed Graphs
		in degree distribution and out degree are used in the Directed Graph
		in degree distribution
			P0 =0.25, P1=0.5, p2 = 0.25
		out degree distribution
			p0=0.25, p1, 0.5, p2= 0.25
	Degrees in Random Graphs
		In random graph, it is non ovbious on how to find the degree distribution
		G(n,p) = n nodes, and p is probability of an edge occuring
		p_k = \lambda^ke^-k/k!
		it is using a poisson distributions
		\lambda = pn
		in a random graph, it is very close to a normal distribution. this means that most people are in the average value of  distribution
		Bell Curve slot machine is an example of a normal distribution
	Degrees in real world networks
		Real World networks vrs random graphs
		Key point
			degree distributions in real world networks are very differnt from those random graph
		real world networkss
			contain much more hubs (nodes of high degree) than predicted by poisson distributions
		if internet was random
			dispersion would be 2.5s and max degree would be 20
		in reality:
			its real dispersion is 14
			the maximum degree is more than 2400
		a similar difference occurs in other real world network
	Double Logarithm Plots
		log log plots
		Problem, when plotting a curve that includes very small and very large values at the same axis, difference between small values are indistinguishable
		plotting in log for both axis, will help explain more what is going on
		log log graphs are linear
		cumulative distribution can be showin iwth a log log graph
		Read 10.3 for more details
Power Laws
	Scale free Networks
	power law holds for networks, city population and other networks
	What is a Power Law
		The curve on log scales is clsose to a straigh line in a log log graph
		Degree distributions in most real world networks approximately follow power laws
		pk is proportional to some degree of k
		p_k - \sumCK^-\alpha
		wher pk is the graction fonodes with degree k
		C is the constant determined by the normalization condition
		\alpha is a constant, typically between 2 and 3
		power law is equivalient of logpk = c-\alpha log k
		so logpk is linear in log(pk)
		networks with pwoer law degree distributions are often called scale free networks.
			scale free is rooted in theory of phase transitin, a branch of statistical physics.
			in random graph, its natural that the degree is close to the average. 
			but in a scale free one, we can not determine this expected value
	Examples of power laws
		not just in networks
		Zipf Laws - occurance of words in languages
			has an alpha of 2.2. The amount occurance words in the english languages is the
