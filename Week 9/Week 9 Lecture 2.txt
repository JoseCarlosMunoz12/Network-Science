Models of Network Formation
	Two types of model
		Preferential attachement
		Copying model
	Preferential Attachement model
		Distribution of wealth also show a power law model
		why?--capitalism, the exploitation of power.
		H Simons sys that rate propotional to how much they currently have is based on your income already.
	The barabasi-Albert Model
		initital netowrk
			start with a small one
		Growth
			each new node is connected with already existing node with some probabilitistic mechanism. Its called preferential attachement
		Any new node can connect to existing node. But the probability of connecting to an existing node i is propotional to its degreee k_i
	More Formally
		Init Net -> stat with a netowrk that has m_0 nodes.
		Growth-> add new nodes on by one
			each node has a p(i) a probability that is is chosen for connecting to the new node.
			p(i) = \frac{ki}{\sum_j(k_j)}
	Power Law Degree Distribution
		it wa sprovedhat netowrks formed using the barabasi-Albert model have a power law degree with \alpha 3
		the degree is independent of m and m_0
		it also shows that iteration doesn't affect the degree distribution. So it i sstationary
		Preferential Models are sometimes called rich get riche model
	Price's Model
		p(i) = \frac{a + k_i}{ \sum_j(a + k_j)}
		each node has a positive constant a called the attractiveness parameter
		This nodes it is not required that each new node is connected to the same number of existing nodes.
		this model gives rise a similar power law in dgree distribution
	Non Linear Preferential Attachement
		we assume that thexisting node i with probability propotional to the weight of i, why?
		Answer
			assume that a new nodes existing node i with probability propotional to ki^d then
				if d<1 then hubs do not apear 
				if d > 1 then thaere is only one supe hub
			in real world these things don not occure, therefore, we can say that node i is proportional to the weight of i
	is the assumption reasonable?
		the assumption makes sense for netowks where the degree of a node can be beiwed as a measure of the nodes' popularity
		it is not obvious why the assumption holes true for the technological and biological networks.
	Copying Model-Duplicatoin with Mutation
		idea
			As in preferential attachement models, we build a netowk step by step, with a small inital network.At each ste[ a new node coness to some existing node
			A new node links one of the earlier nodes. We copy (slight changes) the links created by one of the earlier nodes.
		Duplicatoin with mutation is shown in section 13.5
	The copying model
		Init network
			a small directed network.
			for simplicity, we assume that every node in this network has a fixed out degree, letm be this out degree
		Growth
			Add new nodes one by one
			for each new node u, choose uniformly at random an existing node v
			use the following probalistiic mechanism
				choose uniformly at random an eistn node v
				for each i = 1, m
					eaither probability y creat a link from u to w
					or else, with probability 1- y, creat a link from u to a node chosen uniformly at random from existing nodes.
