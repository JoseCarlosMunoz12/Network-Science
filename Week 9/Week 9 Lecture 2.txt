Models of Network Formation
	Two types of model
		Preferential attachement
		Copying model
	Preferential Attachement model
		Distribution of wealth also show a power law model
		why?--capitalism, the exploitation of power.
		H Simons sys that rate propotional to how much they currently have is based on your income already.
	The barabasi-Albert Model
		initital netowrk
			start with a small one
		Growth
			each new node is connected with already existing node with some probabilitistic mechanism. Its called preferential attachement
		Any new node can connect to existing node. But the probability of connecting to an existing node i is propotional to its degreee k_i
	More Formally
		Init Net -> stat with a netowrk that has m_0 nodes.
		Growth-> add new nodes on by one
			each node has a p(i) a probability that is is chosen for connecting to the new node.
			p(i) = \frac{ki}{\sum_i(k_j)}
