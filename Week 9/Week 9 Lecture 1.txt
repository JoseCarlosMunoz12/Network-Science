Degree Distrubition and Powe Law
	What is a degree distribution of a networks
		its the distribution of each nodes having some probability of it having a degree of k
		A distribution is a vector. Sequence used more for a list of objects, a vector is more for numbers
		Its a vector of numbers that each element is the frequency of a random vertex has a degree of the index
	What can we see of a degree distribution.
		if the values of each sequence are the same, the graph is regular
		Most important ones are normal distribution and the power law distribution
	The power law is the 80/20 rule
	The power law can also be considered as a measurement of popularity
	Using a log log, we see that the graph turns into a straight line for a power law distribution
	In directed graph, we can use modularity. Modularity is more for undirected graph. the log log works well for both in and out degree movement
	
Power Laws
	Main observation
		pk = Ck^-\alpha
		pk is proportional to k
		p+k is the graction of nodes with degree k
		C is a constant determined by the normalization condition.
		\alpha is a constant, typically between 2 and 3
	Scale free networks, the probability of a degree doesn't not dependon the network
	Why are power law graphs used alot?
		All real world network are create form small networks to large networks
		Similar to many biological, mechanical, etc, its build step by step. This could explain the method of a power law occuring. this is called network formation
	Have several hypothises on a formation of a network
	The idea is that the property of a power law occuring is due to the formation off a netorowk
