Week 5 Lecture 2
Similarity
	Recap-Jaccard Coefficients-hamming Distance-Edit Distance
		Measure Similarity in networks.
		jaccard Coefficients - similarity of two set of objects
			How to detect if two webpages are duplicates
			Google and Yahoo and Bing search enginess check to see if a page is a duplicate with Jaccard Coefficients.
			J(A,B) = \size of intersection of A and B
			devided by size of union of A and B
			The Larget Jaccard Coefficient will be the most similiar of two sets
			Set A = {c,e,f, i,j,m,o,p,q, s,t,u,y}
			|A| = 13,|B_1|=8,|B_2|=9,|B_3|=9
			J(A, B_1) = |3| / |18|=0.167
			J(A, B_2) = |6| / |16|=0.375
			J(A, B_3) = |4| / |18|=0.222
			B_2 is the most similar
			Union(A,B) = |A| + |B|+ Intersection(A,B)
		Hamming Distance
			Measure of Similarity between String of the same length
				#number of position in whic ther is different
				ex
				H(London, Boston) = 3
				London
				Boston
				X_XX__ = 3
			S =   0101101000
			S_3 = 0010110001
			S_1 = 0101010101
			S_2 = 1010101010
			H(S,S_1) = 10-5 = 5
			H(S,S_2) = 10-5 = 5
			H(S,S_3) = 10-6 = 4
		Edit Distance
			ED(pcrarot,carrot) = 3
			ED(pcrarot,parrot) = 2
			ED(pcrarot,tarot) = 3

Recommender Networks
	Bipartate Newtork
		has user and items
		user is related to some item and other user are related to other items. each user ranks the item according to thier liking
	Ratings
		such networks are augemented with labeling all edes by numbersL a number assigned to an edge connecting a user and an item is a rating given by the user to the item.
	Recommder system are based on a technique called collaborative filtering. The recommender network is use to make a prediction for a given user: which of the items will the user like
	there are two forms of collaborative filtering
		user to user form
		item to item form
		
	How to calculate similarity on users?
		The profile of our items are similar Is the item is bought by a set of user and such sets are similar, then we can predict what a user can use
	User to User Collaborative Filtering
		A typical table is spare: most entries are empty
	Inderct ratings
		Entries in the table may have various inteptreation, not necessarily explicit rating.
		ex as in amount of time a user stays on a channel a week.
	Normalized Ratings
		it is common to normalize entries in recommender tales. an empty entry is replaced with 0
		Typically , there is a big difference between user in thier average ratings
	Profile
		Each user can now be set with some vector to describe what they want, a profile
		so a user has a vector X^T
	User to user collaborative idea:
		step 1 Find a user V whose profile is similar to profile U.
		step 2 Find an item that has high rating given by V, but not yet being rated by U. Recommend I to U
		the assumption is that U and V are siilar states in the past, then they will have similar opinions in the future
	Similarity in Euclidean Space
		Euclidean distance or cosine similarity
		Cosine similarity is better than the Euclidean distance for finding similarity
		3,3 - 1,-2 = 2,5 = 4 + 25 = 29 = \sqrt(29)
		not good in recommender system, we need direction not magnitude of distance. Direction shows taste
		just a dot product
		sim(X,Y) = X*Y/|X|*|Y|
